# users_practice

<div align='center'> Trial enviroment for user data handling and data hashing techniques </div>

### Route used:
- Project starts with an API connection to get a JSON full of fake users or dummies (DummyAPI, DummyJSON, etc.).
- Creation of a hashing algorithm:  
  - We have several hashing options (SHA 1, SHA 256, etc.), but we will use the default hashing from *bcrypt* library.
  - We'll add salt to every hash operation as well.
- Get the JSON Dummy data as well as encrypted passwords (just for the sake of practice).
- Have fun while learning!
